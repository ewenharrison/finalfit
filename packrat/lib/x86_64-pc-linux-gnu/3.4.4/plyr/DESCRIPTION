Package: plyr
Version: 1.8.4
Title: Tools for Splitting, Applying and Combining Data
Description: A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you
    need to break a big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on
    each piece and then put all the pieces back together.  For example,
    you might want to fit a model to each spatial location or time
    point in your study, summarise data by panels or collapse
    high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary statistics. The
    development of 'plyr' has been generously supported by 'Becton
    Dickinson'.
