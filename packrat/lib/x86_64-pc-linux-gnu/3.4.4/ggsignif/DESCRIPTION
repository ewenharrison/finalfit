Title: Significance Brackets for 'ggplot2'
Version: 0.4.0

Description: Enrich your 'ggplots' with group-wise comparisons. This
    package provides an easy way to indicate if two groups are
    significantly different. Commonly this is shown by a bracket on top
    connecting the groups of interest which itself is annotated with
    the level of significance (NS, *, **, ***). The package provides a
    single layer (geom_signif()) that takes the groups for comparison
    and the test (t.test(), wilcox.text() etc.) as arguments and adds
    the annotation to the plot.
