Description: R and 'Eigen' integration using 'Rcpp'. 'Eigen' is a C++
    template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical
    solvers and related algorithms.  It supports dense and sparse
    matrices on integer, floating point and complex numbers,
    decompositions of such matrices, and solutions of linear systems.
    Its performance on many algorithms is comparable with some of the
    best implementations based on 'Lapack' and level-3 'BLAS'. The
    'RcppEigen' package includes the header files from the 'Eigen' C++
    template library (currently version 3.3.4). Thus users do not need
    to install 'Eigen' itself in order to use 'RcppEigen'. Since
    version 3.1.1, 'Eigen' is licensed under the Mozilla Public License
    (version 2); earlier version were licensed under the GNU LGPL
    version 3 or later. 'RcppEigen' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to
    'Eigen') is licensed under the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is
    the rest of 'Rcpp'.
