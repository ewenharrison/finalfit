Description: Two nonparametric methods for multiple regression
    transform selection are provided. The first, Alternative
    Conditional Expectations (ACE), is an algorithm to find the fixed
    point of maximal correlation, i.e. it finds a set of transformed
    response variables that maximizes R^2 using smoothing functions
    [see Breiman, L., and J.H. Friedman. 1985. "Estimating Optimal
    Transformations for Multiple Regression and Correlation". Journal
    of the American Statistical Association. 80:580-598.
    <doi:10.1080/01621459.1985.10478157>]. Also included is the
    Additivity Variance Stabilization (AVAS) method which works better
    than ACE when correlation is low [see Tibshirani, R.. 1986.
    "Estimating Transformations for Regression via Additivity and
    Variance Stabilization". Journal of the American Statistical
    Association. 83:394-405. <doi:10.1080/01621459.1988.10478610>]. A
    good introduction to these two methods is in chapter 16 of Frank
    Harrel's "Regression Modeling Strategies" in the Springer Series in
    Statistics.
