\title{Check accurate recoding of variables}
\usage{
check_recode(
  .data,
  dependent = NULL,
  explanatory = NULL,
  include_numerics = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{Data frame or tibble.}

\item{dependent}{Optional character vector: name(s) of depdendent
variable(s).}

\item{explanatory}{Optional character vector: name(s) of explanatory
variable(s).}

\item{include_numerics}{Logical. Include numeric variables in function.}

\item{...}{Pass other arguments to \code{\link{agrep}}.}
}
\value{
List of length two. The first is an index of variable combiations.
  The second is a nested list of crosstables as tibbles.
}
\description{
This was written a few days after the retraction of a paper in JAMA due to an
error in recoding the treatment variable
(\url{https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2752474}). This
takes a data frame or tibble, fuzzy matches variable names, and produces
crosstables of all matched variables. A visual inspection should reveal any
miscoding.
